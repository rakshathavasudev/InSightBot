0.16: so let me ask you a question that might
1.92: be lurking in the back of your mind
3.36: right now am I too dumb for machine
5.12: learning if you've ever sat there
6.64: staring at a bug you can't figure out or
8.48: reading a paper where you understand
9.92: maybe every fifth word or watching your
11.92: colleagues or classmates discuss complex
14.08: algorithms like they're talking about
15.44: the weather then yeah I get it that
17.6: voice in your head starts whispering
19.199: "Maybe I'm just not cut out for this."
20.96: Today I want to talk about that feeling
22.8: that creeping sense that everyone else
24.72: belongs here except you it has a name
27.039: imposttor syndrome and it's really
28.64: common in challenging fields like
29.92: machine learning but here's what I
31.199: promise by the end of this video you'll
33.28: understand why these feelings happen how
35.12: to deal with them and more importantly
37.04: why feeling kind of dumb might actually
38.719: be your secret superpower let's start
40.399: with the reality of the situation
42.079: machine learning is hard it's a field
43.76: that combines advanced math computer
45.52: science data analysis and sometimes
47.52: domain expertise in areas like biology
49.44: or finance nobody starts off feeling
51.28: like they've got it all figured out at
52.719: the beginning it's completely normal to
54.16: feel lost basically all the time the
56.079: learning curve is steep the field is
57.76: constantly evolving and there's always
59.6: someone who seems to know way more than
61.199: you do because they probably do but
63.12: here's what I found that feeling doesn't
65.36: necessarily go away even when you're
67.28: pretty advanced the learning never stops
69.36: and if you're in the right rooms which
70.72: you should be you'll often find yourself
72.64: surrounded by people who know things you
74.08: don't that's not a bug it's a feature
76.159: when I started my first real machine
77.68: learning job at Corsera I was in way
79.68: over my head they hired me to work on
81.52: production machine learning systems when
83.119: all I had ever done before was work with
84.799: CSVs and Jupyter notebooks suddenly I
87.28: needed to understand distributed
88.64: computing model deployment monitoring
90.56: systems and all sorts of infrastructure
92.32: I had never worked with before i
93.92: remember sitting in meetings nodding
95.36: along googling a whole bunch of stuff
97.28: trying to figure out what was going on i
99.04: kind of felt like a fraud like someone
100.799: had maybe made a huge mistake in hiring
102.799: me so what did I do i worked really hard
106.479: i put in work on the weekends for
108.24: several months i took courses on things
110.24: I didn't understand before work i read
112.159: documentation until my eyes bled i asked
114.56: questions took notes and kept trying and
116.72: you know what after about 6 months I
119.04: caught up the concepts started to click
120.96: the systems began to make sense and I
122.64: was delivering actual products that were
124.24: valuable and impactful and I wasn't even
125.92: that slow anymore i even ended up
127.52: getting promoted less than a year after
128.8: that now when I'm in a room with people
130.399: who are objectively smarter than me
132.0: which happens all the time I don't
133.599: experience that same imposter feeling
135.2: anymore not because I know everything
137.28: far from it but because I've proven to
139.52: myself that I can figure things out
140.8: given enough time and persistence so
142.72: what's actually happening when we feel
144.08: like imposters research shows it boils
146.319: down to three key components first
148.239: there's fear it's a primal anxiety
150.56: response tied to our evolutionary fear
152.4: of being excluded from the group we
154.48: worry about being exposed or found out
156.72: second there's shame this isn't just
159.12: self-doubt it's a deeper feeling of I am
161.2: wrong or I am not enough at a
162.959: fundamental level and third these
164.959: feelings get embedded in our emotional
166.64: brain patterns often from early
168.4: experiences in life that's why you can't
170.8: just logic your way out of imposter
172.4: syndrome so how do we deal with this let
174.8: me share some mindset shifts that have
176.4: helped me and many others first it pays
178.959: to be a little bit delusional i know
180.879: that sounds strange but hear me out
182.72: think about Arnold Schwarzenegger this
184.8: guy arrived in the US barely speaking
186.48: English told everyone he was going to be
188.319: the greatest bodybuilder of all time
190.0: then a movie star then governor of
191.84: California and he did all of it why
194.56: because he just didn't ever doubt
196.159: himself he put himself out there and
198.4: worked as hard as he needed to achieve
200.319: what most would consider impossible
201.92: dreams in practical terms one thing I
204.319: often see in my mentoring work is
206.0: talented people hold themselves back by
208.0: not applying for jobs they think they
209.519: aren't qualified for this is imposttor
211.44: syndrome doing real damage to your
213.12: career here's my advice don't eliminate
215.36: yourself from opportunities let the
217.36: recruiter make that decision if it comes
218.879: to it but don't take the opportunity
220.56: away from yourself before you even try
222.72: so what if you're a little
223.519: underqualified channel your inner
225.2: Schwarzenegger be a little delusional
227.04: and go for it second most people aren't
229.519: as good as you think they are seriously
231.68: we tend to overestimate the competition
233.76: and underestimate ourselves remember
235.68: that you're comparing your behind the
237.439: scenes to everyone else's highlight reel
239.439: people don't showcase their failures
241.12: their confusion or all the times they've
242.799: been lost they show the polished result
245.12: third realize that if you're
246.48: experiencing imposttor syndrome you're
248.319: probably not falling victim to the
249.84: Dunning Krueger effect which is where
251.36: people who know very little think they
252.879: know a lot the fact that you're
254.159: self-critical means you have enough
255.84: knowledge to recognize how much you
257.6: don't know yet that self-awareness is
259.68: actually a sign of butdding competence
261.44: and finally often the most successful
263.44: people in any field are just the ones
265.44: who are willing to be beginners longer
267.44: the ones who are willing to suck at
268.8: stuff to ask the dumb questions and to
270.96: make mistakes in public i'm not good at
272.8: things because I am naturally super
274.4: gifted but because I'm stubborn i will
276.639: keep trying over and over until I get it
279.12: i don't care if I suck at first because
280.88: that just means I have a hill to climb
282.4: and I like hiking all right so that all
284.72: sounds nice but how do we actually put
286.479: this into practice here are some
288.24: concrete things you can do when imposter
290.24: syndrome hits first look at the evidence
292.639: keep a folder with your accomplishments
294.56: positive feedback and problems you've
296.16: solved review it regularly especially
298.32: when doubts creep in second take
300.24: compliments when someone praises your
302.0: work resist the urge to deflect just say
304.08: "Thank you," and let yourself absorb it
306.24: third practice saying "I don't know,"
308.4: without shame and notice when others do
310.479: it too it reduces the pressure of
312.24: feeling like you need to know everything
313.759: plus being willing to admit when you
315.52: don't know something will make people
316.8: like you more not the other way around
318.88: we are naturally drawn to humility
320.8: especially in competitive fields where
322.4: it can sometimes be rare fourth
324.4: recognize internal and external
326.28: comparisons remember you're comparing
328.24: your inner experience to others outer
330.0: presentations and finally document your
332.72: progress keep track of what you're
334.479: learning and how far you've come this
336.24: creates tangible proof of your growth
338.08: that you can revisit if you need a boost
340.08: but really the most powerful step is to
342.32: transform imposttor syndrome from an
344.16: obstacle into fuel when you feel
345.84: inadequate use it as motivation to dig
348.16: deeper when you don't understand
349.6: something let that drive you to break it
351.36: down into smaller pieces you can grasp
353.28: when you feel behind let it push you to
355.039: put in the extra hours i've seen this in
356.8: my own career and in the journeys of
358.4: many successful people in all walks of
360.24: life that feeling of not being enough
362.16: can be redirected into a powerful force
364.24: for growth and remember instead of
366.24: comparing yourself to others compare
368.0: yourself to where you were 6 months ago
370.08: are you learning are you growing that's
372.4: what actually matters so are you too
374.56: dumb for machine learning if you're
376.16: genuinely interested in the field if
377.919: you're willing to put in the work and if
379.44: you're stubborn enough to keep going
381.039: even when it's hard then no probably not
383.44: machine learning is a challenging field
385.199: but it's not reserved for some special
387.039: class of superhuman intellects it's
389.199: accessible to anyone with the
390.479: determination to keep showing up keep
392.24: learning and keep pushing through the
393.52: discomfort the real question isn't
395.36: whether you're smart enough it's whether
396.88: you care enough to keep going when it
398.479: gets tough and if you're watching this
399.919: video if you're concerned about getting
401.6: better if you're self-aware enough to
403.28: question your abilities then you're
404.8: already on the right path so stay
406.8: stubborn keep learning and I'll see you
408.639: in the next
